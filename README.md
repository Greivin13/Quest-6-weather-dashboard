  ## Features
- Search Functionality: The dashboard includes a search input where users can enter the name of a city they want to check the weather for.

- Current Weather Display: Upon searching for a city, the application presents the user with the city name, current date, an icon representation of weather conditions, temperature, humidity, and wind speed.

- 5-Day Forecast: Along with the current weather, the dashboard also displays a 5-day forecast that shows the date, weather icon, temperature, wind speed, and humidity.

- Search History: The application maintains a search history of the cities the user has looked up. Clicking on a city in the search history will once again show the current and future weather conditions for that city.

- LocalStorage: The application uses LocalStorage to store the search history, allowing users to revisit the dashboard and see their previous searches even after closing the browser.

- User Interface: The dashboard provides an intuitive and easy-to-navigate user interface, ensuring a smooth user experience. It resembles the mock-up provided in the challenge instructions and features a clean and polished style.
